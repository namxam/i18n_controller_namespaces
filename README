I18nControllerNamespaces
========================

This plugin extends the I18n translations in controllers to behave the 
same way as views. This means, that each translation call beginning 
with a dot '.' will be prefixed with a namespace. This automatic scoping 
takes into account the modules, class name, and method name. So a call in 
Admin::UsersController.index will be prefixed with 'admin.users.index'.

**Note:** This plugin has only very limited test coverage. So please 
run your test suite before using it in production. I hope I will find 
time to extend it. Or just fork and add it yourself.

Example
-------

class UserController < ApplicationController
  
  # POST: /users
  def create
    # your app logic
    redirect_to :index, :notice => t('.success')
  end
  
end

After creating a new user, this controller would redirect you to the 
users index and would show a flash notice message with the key

users.create.success
